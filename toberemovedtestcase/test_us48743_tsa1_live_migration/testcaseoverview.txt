TC1: Single data link failure handling - instance live migration
----------------------------------------------------------------

Setup:
* Configure first compute with single data link without aggregation
* Configure second compute
* Start one or more VM instances on first compute
* Ensure there are no instances on second compute
* Ensure both computes are unlocked-enabled-available for 1 minute

Action: fail the data link on first compute

Verify:
* Wait for up to 10 seconds for degrade
* Wait up to 3 minutes for instances to be live migrated
* Check for applicable alarm
* Verify that instances were successfully live migrated to second compute
* Verify all migrated instances are all running and healthy on second compute

Action: Lock second compute

Verify:
* Lock of second compute is rejected with "task: Please enable more compute resources"
* No instances migrate to first compute

Action: clear fault, wait 1 minute, lock second compute

Verify:
* Lock succeeds after live migration (up to 5 minute timeout)
* All instances are live migrated back to first compute
* Verify all migrated instances are all running and healthy on first compute
