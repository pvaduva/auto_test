2 controller
2 compute scenario
both computes have data link aggregation

Compute-0 has instance

    Action: lock second compute, wait or lock to complete and then fail both data links

    Verify:
•	wait for up to 10 seconds for degrade
•	wait up to 3 minutes for instances migration to fail and be forcefully evacuated. (no compute to evacuate to)
•	first compute is auto-reset
•	check for applicable alarm

    wait for first compute to go from unlocked-disabled-failed to unlocked-enabled-degraded (10 minute timeout)

    Verify:
•	no instances running on first compute.
•	first compute is unlocked-enabled-degraded
•	no instances running on locked second compute

Action: Unlock second compute

Verify:
•	evacuated instances are started on the freshly unlocked second compute.  <- Jira CGTS-999 raised

Action: restore one link on first compute

Verify:
•	first compute host remains degraded
•	no instances are running on first compute
•	all instances are still running on second compute
•	applicable alarm is raised (may be major only now though)

Action: restore first compute second link

Verify:
•	first compute degrade clears within 35 seconds
•	applicable alarm clears

Action: Lock second compute

Verify:
•	Lock succeeds after live migration (up to 5 minute timeout)
•	all instances are live migrated back to first compute
