	test_610_7_combo_test_cli_lock_compute
	
	Combines the following test cases (saving 0 locks):
	.	test_478_reject_delete_unlock_compute_node
	.	test_610_5_reject_trying_to_swact_compute
	.	
	.	
	
NOTE: uses floating IP address of controller

runtime = 0m4s

Steps:
1)  Connecting to controller
2)  Source env
3)  Set up sudo root access (to make it easier later in the interact session)
4)  Show version
5)  Get active and standby controller
6)  Validate computes are unlocked
7)  Reject request to delete unlocked compute node - test_478_reject_delete_unlock_compute_node
8)  Reject request to swact compute - test_610_5_reject_trying_to_swact_compute
